You wake up to the mild, soothing scent of coffee brewing. It washes over you, unclogging your sleepy mind, freeing you from the shackles of lethargy. You lie awake, eyes open, staring at the ceiling fan while you hear a morning melody. She looks at you from the kitchen with her beautiful, vibrant brown eyes. Both of you smile. After an affectionate embrace, you stare at her from across the coffee table, wondering at the silky-haired marvel in front of you. Slowly savouring the coffee, she gently holds a book with one hand, deeply amused by something. She turns her gaze towards you, looking into your eyes, feeling at home in your presence. She asks what is bothering you, as a reaction to your expressionless face. She doesn’t understand. She doesn’t know. She doesn’t know how grateful you are to be able to wake up to her morning breath everyday, to behold her brown, rosy cheeks every night as you go to bed. She doesn’t know that you would not wish for a better life, that you wouldn’t have it any other way. She doesn’t know. She doesn’t know that she isn’t real, that she is a figment of your imagination. She doesn’t know that she is just a fantasy, and her world is but a dream, and that she really sits across the classroom from you, regarding you with one disgusted eye.
